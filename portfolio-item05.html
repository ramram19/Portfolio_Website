        <p>For this project, I was given the task of creating 
            the layout, images, text, color theme and infographics. The information was already 
            provided for me so I didn't have to create the content for the handbook. For the initial 
            phase, I needed to get ideas of where I wanted to go with the handbook. I went looking 
            online for inspiration and to see what I could put my own spin on. After I had gathered 
            everything I needed for inspiration, it was time for sketching and mockups.
        </p>
        <p>I created three mockups for my boss to see which direction she wanted me to go in.
            She chose the one that's currently here. With that, I started to focus on the criteria
            for this project. It neeeded to hold the content, be presentable, pleasing to look 
            at, have our company logo color, not be filled with text, but spread out with 
            infographics. With this in mind, I went straight in and started designing.
        </p>
        <p>With any project, there's going to be revisions after revisions being made. This one isn't
            any different. Colors had to be updated, layouts shifted, and infographics changed. However,
            in the end, the project was finally finished.
