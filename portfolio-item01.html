        <p>What initially inspired me to create this piece was, the anime show Demon Slayer. 
            I believe the first season had just ended and I loved the blacksmith's character design, 
            specifically Hotaru Haganezuka. I love the way his character interacted with the protagonist of 
            the show. And that's all I will say about that because the show is really great and I don't 
            want to spoil anything!
        </p>
        <p>When I initially started this project, I was still in the process of learning
            Illustrator. Like many of my projects, I hope to learn something new with each project.
            I didn't really know how to use the pen tool very well. It took me longer than I'd like 
            to admit to finish because I was learning the pen tool and how textures worked. Don't even get 
            me started on the textures as my Illustrator file basically loads like a potato because 
            there's so many textures stacked on top of each other. 
        </p>
        <p>With this project I learned how to use the pen tool, even though in hindsight I was still using 
            it incorrectly. However, it still taught me some of the uses of the pen tool. I also learned 
            how to insert textures into Illustrator, which again, in hindsight, should have been done 
            in Photoshop as Illustrator tanked on me when I was doing it.
