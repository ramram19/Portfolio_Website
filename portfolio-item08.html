        <h3>All Rise 2025</h3>
        <br>
        <iframe width="96%" height="500em" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cIk414SX6M?si=YKS_ih_7TZXh6cwi" title="YouTube video player"

        <p class="portfolio-item-image-text">
            This was also a fun video to work on. Orange County Superior Court All Rise program went over a week long so a lot of footage to
            look through and put 
            together. Everyone involved was really on board and it was just a treat to work with not only the team running the program, 
            but also the kids were great and gave great energy throughout the week.
        </p>
        <h3>Court Interpreter - Certification Process</h3>
        <br>
        <iframe width="96%" height="500em" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jNFTuUkiQDc?si=cuwkgHCFz7qjEecc" title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>I was tasked with creating a video for future Court Interpreters. Since the process of attaining your certification requires
            many steps, I made a video showing the step by step process. I wanted to show it in a way that would want to make people 
            stay and watch the whole video. Also, I really did not want to use any form of templates and animate everything myself to show
            that I am capable of creating animations and make it appealing to watch, which I succeeded in doing. I believe for this video
            we had an over 75% watch rate.

        <h3>Collaborative Courts - Drug Court</h3>
        <br>
        <iframe width="96%" height="500em" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lk5RXu2AMtk?si=1LqZyzuRaP77bwcd" title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen class="portfolio-item-image"></iframe>
        <p class="portfolio-item-image-text">
        This video I worked with the Collaborative Court team to cover the drug court program they had. They wanted to showcase participants
        in the program but also include the presiding judge and what the drug court program covers. Video all done by myself.
        </p>

        <h3>Collaborative Courts 30th Anniversary</h3>
        <br>
        <iframe width="96%" height="500em" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/127dCQQzSck?si=Pko3yYvYGnX4_HO9" title="YouTube video player"

        referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen class="portfolio-item-image"></iframe>
        <p class="portfolio-item-image-text">
            This was a special video for me, not only in terms of setting up everyone to record, but I was able to show all of the skills 
            I had attained for the past three and a half years as a Multimedia Designer. Whether it be the angles, lighting, scripting and
            pre-production. Although this was towards the end of my stay while working for the Orange County Superior Court, I left and
            was unable to work on the post-production side of this video. I was able to use all aspects of my skills to be put into this video.
            Everything in this video was shot by me including setting up audio, choosing locations, and lighting as well.

        <h3>Orange County Superior Court Health Benefits</h3>
        <br>

        <p class="portfolio-item-image-text">
            

            Wanted to create a video showcasing some of the health benefits the Orange County Superior Court offers for future potential 
            employees.

        <h3> Orange County Superior Court Holiday Closures</h3>
        <br>
        <iframe width="96%" height="500em"

        allowfullscreen class="portfolio-item-image"></iframe>
        <p class="portfolio-item-image-text">
            I proposed to my boss this video idea where instead of just posting plain text on to our linkedin page for our holiday court 
            closures, we could do something more engaging. I am happy how these came out.
