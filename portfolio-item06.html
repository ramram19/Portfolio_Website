        <p>My friend came to me asking to make a logo/mascot for his twitch channel.
            He already had an idea of what he wanted it to look like and we ran from there.
            I started out getting inspiration online and seeing what direction he wanted to 
            go in. I gave him a couple of sketches to look at ranging from gaming logos to 
            more cartoon styles. He chose a few that he liked and didn't like. From there, 
            he went with the cartoon style.
        </p>
        <p>I gave him another two samples to look at and he chose the current one that is pictured 
            above. Of course, there were many iterations from what it started as to 
            what it looks like now.
        </p>
        <img src="img/videos/Main Comp 1080p_3.gif" alt="eagle shifting between focus and out-of-focus" class="portfolio-item-image-content">
        <p>I also made him an intro screen which was fun to learn how to do. I made this in 
            After Effects, which is a fun program for creating motion graphics. I used camera 
            manipulation to create the angled look of the moving background. I also changed the 
            focus range of the camera to give it blurred edges and the center to be in focus.
