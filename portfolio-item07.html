        <p>This was a work project assigned to me to create a calendar 
            that was inclusive and diverse. Things that needed to be included were: quotes for 
            each month, different color for each month, had to have notes, and each picture 
            had to showcase diversity and inclusivity.
        </p>

        <img src="img/calendar/Inside_saveforweb50.png" alt="calendar content with girl and quote" class="portfolio-item-image-content">

        <p>For some background information, I already finished a similar calendar for the 
            organization so I had the groundwork layed out. By this I mean, I had the content 
            placeholders ready in Indesign to be adjusted for the year 2021. That saved me some 
            time and very grateful for past me for doing this. 
        </p>
        <p>Now, with that out of the way, I went in and looked for images that fit the criteria. 
            Let me tell you, finding images may seem easy, but can take some time to find 
            excellent images that pop and are shot well. Once I was done doing that, I had to find 
            quotes that fit the theme of the calendar. For the quotes, it was the same process as 
            the images, took a bit of time to find some that fit. Now, once I had the quotes and 
            the images, I had to get them approved before I could actually finish placing them 
            inside the Indesign file. Which was a positive outcome, but of course, a few did not 
            make the cut and had to be replaced. Repeated the approval process again and all was good!
        </p>
        <p>For the final portion of this project, I inputed each quote and image into each placeholder, 
            moved some dates and years around and now it was ready for final approval. Nothing is 
            ever ready after your first final draft, so I needed to make some minor changes to visual
            errors and it was ready for print! 
        </p>
